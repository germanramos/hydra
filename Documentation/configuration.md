# Hydra Installation

## Ubuntu/Debian

Add PPAs for:  
https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/libpgm  
https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/zeromq  
  
and execute:  
```
sudo dpkg -i hydra-3-0.x86_64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```
## CentOS/RedHat/Fedora
```
sudo yum install libzmq3-3.2.2-13.1.x86_64.rpm hydra-3-0.x86_64.rpm
```

## Run
Check the configurations files "hydra.conf" and "apps.json" under /etc/hydra directory. After that just run:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/hydra start
```

# Hydra Configuration

The hydra configuration file ("/etc/hydra/hydra.conf") includes many of the options availables in the <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/README.md">ETCD</a> configuration and these arguments preserve the same names than the original version of etcd.

Configuration options can be set in two places:

 1. Command line flags
 2. Configuration file

Options set on the command line take precedence over all other sources.

## Command Line Flags

### Required

* `-name` - The node name. Defaults to the hostname.

### Optional

#### Etcd arguments
* `-addr` - The advertised public hostname:port for client communication. Defaults to `127.0.0.1:7401`.
* `-apps-file` - The path of the application configuration file. Defaults to `/etc/hydra/apps.json`.
* `-bind-addr` - The listening hostname for client communication. Defaults to advertised IP.
* `-discovery` - A URL to use for discovering the peer list. (i.e `"https://discovery.etcd.io/your-unique-key"`).
* `-peers` - A comma separated list of peers in the cluster (i.e `"203.0.113.101:7701,203.0.113.102:7701"`).
* `-ca-file` - The path of the client CAFile. Enables client cert authentication when present.
* `-cert-file` - The cert file of the client.
* `-key-file` - The key file of the client.
* `-config` - The path of the etcd configuration file. Defaults to `/etc/hydra/hydra.conf`.
* `-data-dir` - The directory to store log and snapshot. Defaults to the current working directory.
* `-f, -force` - The node is started as a standalone server when it can not join the cluster.
* `-peer-addr` - The advertised public hostname:port for server communication. Defaults to `127.0.0.1:7701`.
* `-peer-bind-addr` - The listening hostname for server communication. Defaults to advertised IP.
* `-peer-ca-file` - The path of the CAFile. Enables client/peer cert authentication when present.
* `-peer-cert-file` - The cert file of the server.
* `-peer-heartbeat-timeout` - This is the frequency with which the leader will notify followers that it is still the leader and this is also a delay for how long it takes for commands to be committed. Default to 50 milliseconds.
* `-peer-election-timeout` - This timeout is how long a follower node will go without hearing a heartbeat before attempting to become leader itself. Default to 200 milliseconds.
* `-peer-key-file` - The key file of the server.
* `-snapshot=false` - Disable log snapshots. Defaults to `true`.
* `-snapshot-count` - Time interval in milliseconds between the log snapshot are made.

#### Hydra arguments
* `-instance-expiration-time` - This is the ttl for instance information.
* `-private-addr` - The hydra private api hostname:port for probe communication. Defaults to `127.0.0.1:7771`.
* `-public-addr` - The hydra public api hostname:port for client communication. Defaults to `127.0.0.1:7772`.
* `-load-balancer-addr` - The hydra load balancer hostname:port for internal and worker communication. Defaults to `*:7777`.
* `-v, -verbose` - Show logs in DEBUG mode. Defaults to `false`

## Configuration File

The hydra configuration file is written in [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml)
and read from `/etc/hydra/hydra.conf` by default.

```TOML
addr = "127.0.0.1:7401"
apps_file = ""
bind_addr = ""
ca_file = ""
cert_file = ""
data_dir = "."
discovery = "http://etcd.local:4001/v2/keys/_etcd/registry/examplecluster"
force = false
instance_expiration_time = 300
key_file = ""
load_balancer_addr = "*:7777"
peers = []
private_addr = "127.0.0.1:7771"
public_addr = "127.0.0.1:7772"
name = "default-name"
snapshot = true
snapshot_count = 2000
verbose = false

[peer]
addr = "127.0.0.1:7701"
bind_addr = ""
ca_file = ""
cert_file = ""
key_file = ""
heartbeat_timeout = 100
election_timeout = 400
```

# Applications Configuration

The applications settings ("/etc/init.d/apps.json") allow to define for each application how they will be balanced by specifying the (balancers) workers that will be part of the chain and their arguments. For example:


```JSON
[{
	"App1": {
		"Balancers": [
			{
				"worker": "MapAndSort",
				"mapAttr": "cloud",
				"mapSort": ["google", "amazon", "azure"]
			},
			{
				"worker": "SortByNumber",
				"sortAttr": "cpuLoad",
				"order": 1
			}
		]
	}
}, {
	"App2": {
		"Balancers": [
			{
				"worker": "MapByLimit",
				"limitAttr": "limit",
				"limitValue": 50,
				"mapSort": "reverse"
			},
			{
				"worker": "RoundRobin"
				"simple": "OK"
			}
		]
	}
}]
```
