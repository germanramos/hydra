Running graphite under Docker is straightforward:

1. Build the graphite image using Docker
docker build -t graphite .

2. Run a graphite container. Be sure to replace the $IP field with the IP address at which you wish to expose your graphite web service.
docker run -p $IP:8080:80 -p $IP:2003:2003 -d graphite
